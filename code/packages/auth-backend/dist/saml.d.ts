/**
 * SAML 2.0 Service Provider support for the embedded Frontend API.
 *
 * This module is the *only* place SAML XML is handled. It wraps `@node-saml/node-saml` (the
 * standalone core of passport-saml) so the host SP web app never implements SAML itself — it
 * only supplies config. The two protocol operations a Service Provider needs are exposed as
 * small async functions that `frontend.ts` calls from its router, then funnels the verified
 * identity into the *same* session model the Google-OIDC path uses. SAML and OIDC therefore
 * produce an identical `oaf_session` cookie, so `/client`, token minting and `<Protect>` behave
 * the same regardless of which path the user took.
 *
 * Reference IdP: a Google Workspace custom SAML app. Google's IdP gives you three values —
 * an SSO URL (`https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2/idp?idpid=…`), an Entity ID
 * (`https://accounts.google.com/o/saml2?idpid=…`) and an X.509 signing certificate — which map
 * onto `idpSsoUrl`, `idpEntityId` and `idpCert` below. On the Google side you register this
 * SP's ACS URL and Entity ID (see `samlSpMetadata`).
