/**
 * In-process Frontend API — the embedded counterpart to a deployed OpenAuthFederated server.
 *
 * `createAuthFrontend()` returns an Express/Node-compatible middleware that the host app mounts
 * (e.g. `app.use('/api/v1', createAuthFrontend(cfg))`). It implements exactly the endpoints the
 * `@auth/react` `RealAuthCore` calls, so a SPA gets a *real* Google Workspace sign-in with no
 * separate auth server process:
 *
 *   GET  /sign_in/sso                         → 302 to Google's OAuth 2.0 / OIDC authorize URL
 *   GET  /sign_in/sso?strategy=x              → 302 to X's OAuth 2.0 authorize URL (PKCE, no OIDC)
 *   GET  /oauth_callback/x                    → code→token exchange, then GET /2/users/me for the
 *                                               identity, then the same finishSignIn() tail
 *   GET  /oauth_callback                      → code→token exchange, id_token + hd verification,
 *                                               establishes the session cookie, 302 back to the SPA
 *   GET  /environment                         → instance configuration (hosted-IdP-style, secret-free)
 *   GET  /client                              → rehydrate the current session (signed-out = empty)
 *   POST /client/sessions/:id/tokens          → mint a short-lived access JWT for API calls
 *   POST /client/sessions/:id/tokens/:tmpl    → templated token mint (same path, tagged)
 *   POST /client/sessions/:id/touch           → set the session's active organization
 *   GET  /client/sessions/:id/reverify        → step-up: refresh the session's verified-at time
 *   POST /client/sessions/:id/remove          → sign out (clear the session cookie)
 *
 * Everything runs in the host's own process. The human is authenticated by Google (real OIDC
 * round-trip, real id_token signature check against Google's JWKS, real `hd`/`email_verified`
 * enforcement). The app *session* and the short-lived access tokens are signed with a single
 * in-process HS256 secret (`sessionSecret`) — the same secret `verifyToken()` checks in embedded
 * mode — so there is no JWKS endpoint and no second service to run.
